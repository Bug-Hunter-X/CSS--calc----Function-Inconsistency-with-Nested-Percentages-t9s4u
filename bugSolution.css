One approach to mitigate the issue is to avoid relying on nested percentage calculations within the `calc()` function.  Instead, consider using alternative layout methods or JavaScript to dynamically compute the element's dimensions:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  height: auto; /* or use flexbox/grid for height management */
}

/* Example with Flexbox: */
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  flex: 1; /* Distribute available height */
}
```

This solution utilizes flexbox to manage the height of `.element` relative to its parent container.   If a fixed height is still needed, calculate the height dynamically using JavaScript after the parent element's height is determined. This ensures the `calc()` function is not used with uncertain percentage values.
